__KNOWLEDGE GAINED:__
* I think I finally understood how loops work
* following I share some code that examplifies what I worked on
* I had a first glimpse into working with program flowcharts; they seem useful, yet a bit clunky to draw

__IMPROVEMENT/INSIGHT NEEDED:__
* I am still a bit uncertain how to differentiate with certainty between the increments, the current value of the variable
* and what happens within the loop
