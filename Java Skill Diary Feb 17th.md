KNOWLEDGE GAINED:
* I have repeated the application of dynamically expanding arrays, I am semi-certain that I get it
* I learned the difference between "next" and "nextLine" when using the Scanner - very useful
* committing/pushing the "Leetspeak" assignment made me aware of how the StringBuilder class works :)
* an example:
```
StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder();

        for (int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++){
            String character = input.substring(i,i+1);

            switch(character) {
                case "A":
                case "a":
                    output.append("@"); break;
        }                                        
        String result = output.toString();
        System.out.println(result);

* also, I am finally about to finish the codebreaker after receiving useful hints regarding the nested loops necessary


IMPROVEMENT/INSIGHT NEEDED:
* the sorting algorithms are... fuzzy at best, I will need more practice/examples before it get those
